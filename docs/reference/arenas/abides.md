# ABIDES

Financial-market simulation arena based on the ABIDES agent-based interactive discrete event
simulation environment.

## Overview

ABIDES simulates trading agents interacting through a discrete-event market simulator and a
limit-order-book exchange. The CodeClash arena uses compact generated-market simulations so agents
can compete on trading strategy without requiring proprietary market data.

Each CodeClash player edits an ABIDES trading agent. A round evaluates every player in identical
seeded market worlds and scores each player by average mark-to-market profit.

## Implementation

    options:
      show_root_heading: true
      heading_level: 2

## Agent Interface

Your bot must be a Python file named `abides_agent.py` that defines `MyAgent`.

`MyAgent` must be an ABIDES `TradingAgent` subclass and accept the standard ABIDES constructor
arguments used by the arena. A valid starting point is:

```python
from agent.ValueAgent import ValueAgent as MyAgent
```

Agents can use the ABIDES APIs exposed by the upstream `abides-sim/abides` repository. The package
is installed in the ABIDES arena Docker image, not in CodeClash's core Python environment.

Some upstream ABIDES agents, including `ValueAgent`, keep default behavior behind exact-class
checks. If you subclass one of those agents, override the relevant `wakeup` and `receiveMessage`
hooks instead of relying on `pass`.

## Configuration Example

```yaml
tournament:
  rounds: 1
game:
  name: ABIDES
  sims_per_round: 2
  args:
    market_minutes: 5
    background_agents: 3
    timeout: 240
players:
  - agent: dummy
    name: alpha
  - agent: dummy
    name: beta
```

## Scoring

The arena runs `sims_per_round` independent ABIDES market seeds. For each seed, every submitted
CodeClash trading agent is evaluated in its own matching ABIDES market world with an exchange, a
market maker, and background zero-intelligence traders. The final CodeClash score is the player's
average mark-to-market profit across simulations.

## Smoke Test

From the repository root, run the dummy-player example:

```bash
uv run python main.py configs/examples/ABIDES__dummy__r1__s2.yaml -o /tmp/codeclash-abides-smoke
```

Use a fresh `-o` directory when rerunning the smoke check.

Expected shape:

- the command exits with status 0;
- both players pass submission validation;
- stdout includes `In round 0, the winner is ...` and `In round 1, the winner is ...`;
- each round summary contains floating-point mark-to-market scores for `alpha` and `beta`;
- per-simulation details have `status: "ok"`, `cash`, and `shares` fields;
- the output directory contains `metadata.json`, `game.log`, `tournament.log`, and
  `rounds/round_0.tar.gz` / `rounds/round_1.tar.gz`.

A representative `metadata.json` round contains a `scores` object with one floating-point profit
score per player:

```json
"scores": {
  "alpha": -1736.0,
  "beta": -2297.0
}
```

Exact values can change with simulator randomness and configuration; the smoke check is meant to
verify the Docker/runtime adapter path, player-name mapping, and score/log artifact shape.

The exact tournament directory name includes a timestamp, so inspect the metadata with:

```bash
find /tmp/codeclash-abides-smoke -maxdepth 3 -name metadata.json -print
```
