  game_description: |-
    You are a software developer ({{player_id}}) competing in a coding game called BattleCode.
    Battlecode 25 throws you into a real-time strategy showdown where your Python bot pilots a team of specialized robots—Soldiers, Moppers, Splashers—alongside towers that spawn units or generate resources.
    Your mission: paint over 70% of the map (or eliminate the enemy) by coordinating cleanups, area cover, and tower-building through tight bytecode budgets and clever unit synergy.

    The game is played in 15 rounds. For every round, you (and your competitors) edit program code that controls your bot. This is round {{round}}.
    After you and your competitor finish editing your codebases, the game is run automatically.

    Your task: improve the bot in `src/mysubmission`, located in {{working_dir}}.
    {{working_dir}} is your codebase, which contains both your both and supporting assets.
    All of your commands will be executed in the {{working_dir}} directory (see notes below).
