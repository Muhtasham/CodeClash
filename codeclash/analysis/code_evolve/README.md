\ofir{ofir's 4 questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item (1a) when we run say GPT-5 vs Claude, lets say we do just round 1, repeated 20 times, do we get different solutions from claude or gpt-5? or do they keep on doing the same stuff?
    \item (1b) when we run say GPT-5 vs Claude multiple times, all the way to the last round, how different are the last round solutions that GPT-5 generates in every last round? how different are the last round solutions that Claude generates? [and do this for each model in all pairs]
    \item (2a) when we run GPT-5 vs Claude (just one round) and GPT-5 vs Gemini, does gpt-5 program the same initial solution in each?
    \item (2b) how different are the last-round solutions gpt-5 generates when playing against Claude than when playing against Gemini?
\end{itemize}

in case there's high variance, we can talk about it being maybe straightforward that self-play would lead to interesting results that could be used for training?
